#### **Day 7 - 10.23.18**

* ICMP has no ports
* First three hex values in a MAC address are specific to each device manufacturer
* ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
    * Every device on a standard Ethernet network must have an OSI layer 2 and layer 3 address

            * `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` - enables IP forwarding
                * we turn this on so that the target computer will send us packets and then we will forward them on 
            * `ip route` - find IP address of router
            * `arpspoof -i eth0 < <- eth0 is what interface you are using> -t 10.0.2.6 < <- target IP> -r 10.0.2.1 < <- router IP>`

        * A - map a domain name to an IP address
        * CNAME - map a domain name to another domain name, aka an alias
        * MX - mail records, used for handling domain specific mail records since mail servers are often separate from web servers even though they share the same domain name
        * TXT - not used for routing but used as a means to add metadata to a domain
        * NS - shows where the official name servers are that host the original/official DNS record configurations

#### **Day 4 - 10.16.18**

* Networking Notes:
    * Subnetting
        * reduces network traffic
        * divides up a network into smaller parts for faster/easier communication
        * easier management - easier to isolate issues in small networks than one gigantic one and it also enables an administrator to implement security policies such as which subnets are allowed or not allowed to communicate together.
        * How to create subnets
            * take bits from host portion of the IP address and reserve them to define the subnet address
            * fewer bits for the host
            * subnetting steps
                * determine number of required network IDs
                * determine the number of required host IDs per subnet
            * subnetting 5 Qs
                * how many subnets does the chosen subnet mask produce?
                    * 2^x (x = 1)
                    * 2^x = number of subnets
                    * x = the number of masked bits or the 1s
                    * for class C networks check the last byte
                    * Example: 11000000 we would get 2^2 => so there would be 4 possible subnets
                * how many valid hosts per subnet are available?
                    * 2^y - 2 (y = 0) = number of hosts per subnet
                    * y = the number of unmasked bits or 0s
                    * Example: 11000000 = 2^6 - 2 = 62 possible hosts
                    * we subtract 2 for the network address and the broadcast address
                * what are the valid subnets?
                    * 256 - subnet mask = block size
                    * Example: 256 - 192 = 64
                    * each subnet is going to have 64 addresses
                    * so the subnet groups would be 0 - 63, 64 - 127, 128 - 191, 192 - 255
                * what is the broadcast address of each subnet?
                    * the number right before the next subnet
                    * for the above groups the broadcast addresses would be 63, 127, 191, and 255
                * what are the valid hosts in each subnet?
                    * the numbers between the network address and the broadcast address
                    * 1 - 62, 65 - 126, 129 - 190, 193 - 254

        * 1) Physical Layer (Binary)
            * involves media, move bits between devices
            * consists of the physical components in a LAN such as hardware or networking cables
    * Routers
        * by default won't forward any broadcast packets. Without the IP address, a router will not forward any packets
        * routers use the IP address in a network-layer header to deterine the next hop router to forward packets to
        * use routing tables to keep track of routes to neighboring routers so they don't have to ask again and again (kinda like a browser cache)

* Networking Notes:
    * IPv4
        * connectionless protocol or best effort - does not guarantee delivery but uses protocols like TCP to guarantee delivery
        * 32 bit value that uniquely identifies the system on the network
        * i.e. 192.168.1.0
        * uses binary numbers translated into decimal numbering
        * Public addresses are used by the internet and Private are used by internal networks
    * Private IP Addresses:
        * 10.0.0.0 /8 or 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

        * byte - 8 bits
        * octet - 8 bit binary number 
        * network address

                * `192.168.0.0`
            * every machine on the network shares the network address as part of its individual IP address
        * broadcast address

                * `192.168.255.255`
        * host id - uniquely assigned and identifies a specific device 
        * network id - refers to the network the IP is part of 
            * class A allows 3 bytes for the host ID (networkID.hostID.hostID.hostID) (0.0.0.0/8 to 127.0.0.0/8)
            * class B allows 2 bytes for the host ID (networkID.networkID.hostID.hostID) (128.0.0.0/16 to 191.255.0.0/16)
            * class C allows 1 byte for the host ID (networkID.networkID.networkID.hostID) (192.0.0.0/24 to 223.255.255.0/24)
            * an IP will check if computer is on the same network before sending packets directly or to a router
        * default gateway - IP address of the router that can send data from your network
        * subnet mask - used to deterine what bits identify the network ID and what portion identifies the host ID
        * ANDing - how to figure out network address
            * 1 and 1 = 1
            * 0 and 1 = 0
            * 0 and 0 = 0
            * 1 and 0 = 0
            * Step 1: Convert IP address and subnet mask to binary
            * Step 2: AND the binary addresses together
            * Step 3: Convert network address from binary to decimal
        * DNS - domain name service
